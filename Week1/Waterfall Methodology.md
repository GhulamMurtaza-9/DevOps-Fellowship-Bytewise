# Waterfall Methodology

The <b> Waterfall Methodology </b> is a linear project management approach, where stakeholder and customer requirements are gathered at the beginning of the project,
and then a sequential project plan is created to accommodate those requirements. It sets distinct endpoints or goals for each phase of development, and each 
phase must be completed before the next phase can begin. <br>

<b> Phases of Waterfall Methodology </b>
- Requirements phase
- System design phase
- Implementation phase
- Testing phase
- Deployment phase
- Maintenance phase

<b> Benefits of Waterfall Model </b>

The Waterfall methodology provides the following benefits:

- The requirements are clearly and accurately stated, they remain unchanged throughout the entire project development.
- Detailed documentation of each development stage provides resistance to changes in human resources â€“ a new developer can quickly get all the necessary information.
- Careful planning of the project development structure reduces the number of problematic issues1. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.

<b> Drawbacks of WaterFall Model </b>

The Waterfall methodology has the following drawbacks:

- High amounts of risk and uncertainty.
- Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.
- Poor model for long and ongoing projects.
- Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing.
- It is difficult to measure progress within stages.
- Cannot accommodate changing requirements
