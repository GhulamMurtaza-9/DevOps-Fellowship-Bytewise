# What is Software Development Life Cycle 

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the process of planning, writing, and modifying software. It encompasses a set of procedures, methods, 
and techniques used in software development. Developers use the approach as they design and write modern software for computers, cloud deployment, mobile phones, 
video games, and many more.The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates. <br>
<b> The following are the phases of SDLC:</b>

- Analysis and Planning
- Software design such as architectural design
- Software development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance OR Monitoring
