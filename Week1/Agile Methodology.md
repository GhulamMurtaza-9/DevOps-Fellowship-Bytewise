# Agile Methadology 

 Agile Methodology is a Software Project management model that prioritizes flexibility and continuous improvement over following a strict plan. 
It emphasizes collaboration between teams, customers, and stakeholders and encourages open communication and transparency throughout the project lifecycle.
Agile uses short iterations called <b>sprints*</b> to manage and track progress, with regular reviews and assessments to ensure that the project stays on track

 (Scrum is a framework often used in Agile methodology, and a Sprint is part of Scrumâ€™s framework structure. Scrum gives meetings, tools, and roles, while a Sprint 
 is a defined period for creating a feature. Scrum is the Framework in which a sprint takes place. A Sprint is a defined time period for developing features for a         product.)

<b> <h2>Benefits of Agile Model </h2></b>

Here are some benefits of using Agile methodology:

- <b> Superior quality product:</b> <br> 
                 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;           In Agile project management, testing is an integrated part of the project execution phase which means that the overall quality of the final product is greater.<br>
- <b>Customer satisfaction: </b> <br>
   &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Agile methodology focuses on delivering value to the customer and meeting their needs. This leads to higher customer satisfaction.
- <b> Better control: </b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Agile methodology provides better control over the project as it is divided into smaller iterations or sprints. This allows for better monitoring and control of the project.
- <b> Improved project predictability: </b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Agile methodology provides better predictability as the project is divided into smaller iterations. This allows for better estimation of the time and resources required for each iteration.
- <b>Reduced risks:</b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Agile methodology reduces risks as it allows for early detection and resolution of issues.
- <b> Increased flexibility: </b> <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Agile methodology provides increased flexibility as it allows for changes to be made to the project at any stage.
- <b>Continuous improvement: </b>  <br>
&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Agile methodology focuses on continuous improvement which leads to better quality products and processes.
- <b> Improved team morale: </b> <br>
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Agile methodology provides a collaborative environment which leads to improved team morale.
 
 
# Drawbacks of Agile Methadology 

Agile methodology has some disadvantages as well. Here are some of them 123456:

- Teams get easily sidetracked due to lack of processes.
- Long-term projects suffer from incremental delivery.
- The level of collaboration can be difficult to maintain.
- Lack of documentation.
- Less predictable.

# Agile Model VS WaterFall Model 

The Waterfall model is a linear sequential life cycle mode that follows a sequential design process. In contrast, the Agile model is a continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process.

In the Waterfall model, the development of software is done as a single project. The development of software in the Agile model is done as a collection of many small projects.The Agile methodology is known for its flexibility. It follows an incremental approach2, whereas the Waterfall is a sequential design process.
