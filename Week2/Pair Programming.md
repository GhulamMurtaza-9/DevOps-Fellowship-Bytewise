# Pair Programming

Pair programming is a software development technique where two programmers work together at one workstation. One programmer, called the driver, writes code while the
other, called the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. The observer also considers the 
“strategic” direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their
attention on the “tactical” aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide
